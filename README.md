## Job Scraper - FrontEnd Application

This React project will provide users the functionality to Login / SignUp.
They will then input the job keywords they want to search for, and select which of the Job Sites (Reed, Monster, Indeed etc) they want to scrape.
They will then enter their email and will receive an excel sheet with all the relevant jobs for those keywords.

The site is still a WIP, and is hosted on a free Heroku Dyno here, https://jobscrapejames.herokuapp.com/ . It takes about 30 seconds to initilaze the dyno if it has been asleep for a period of time, so please bear this in mind when taking a look.
When it is completed it will probably be hosted on AWS.
