## Job Scraper - FrontEnd Application
This site will allow users to scrape job sites based on keywords.
They will input the job keywords they want to search for, and select which of the Job Sites (Reed, Monster, Indeed etc) they want to scrape.
They will then enter their email and will receive an excel sheet with all the relevant jobs for those keywords.

There will also be a dashboard which will allow them to view past results. I will use this open-source material design for some of the design aspects, https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/react/quick-start/material-dashboard/
The site is still a WIP, and is hosted on a free Heroku Dyno here, https://jobscrapejames.herokuapp.com/ . (Note, for some reason it fails to load the first time,so just reload the page and it works fine). It takes about 30 seconds to initilaze the dyno if it has been asleep for a period of time, so please bear this in mind when taking a look.
When it is completed it will probably be hosted on AWS.
